## Summary

This data package is a component of the Hakai Instituteâ€™s Nearshore research and monitoring program. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations. 

The Rocky Intertidal program is a subset of Hakai Nearshore, and is designed to quantify change in rocky shore intertidal habitats and their associated communities. Please see the list of all Rocky Intertidal program data packages here:

## Survey Methods

This data package collects data and information relating to surveys 
conducted in surfgrass beds on Calvert Island BC, starting in 2017. Shoot counts, average length, and other metrics of ***Phyllospadix spp.*** were measured in quadrats along a transect at each site. For a detailed description, please see the Rocky Intertidal protocol contained in this dataset.

- ***Data*** 
	- **surfgrass_length_density-surveys.csv:** Various parameters relating to the coverage, structure, and health of ***Phyllospadix spp.*** beds in the low rocky intertidal. Survey was conducted using a transect and quadrats. Transect location and length were replicated over time, quadrat placement was not.

> **NOTE:** the column "tide_height_at_survey_time" is no longer recorded from
> February 2023 onwards.
